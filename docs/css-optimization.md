# CSS Optimization Report

The Material Dashboard bundle was rebuilt locally with `pnpm exec sass` to obtain before/after file sizes for the refactored stylesheet.

| Build                                      | CSS Size      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Baseline (`material-dashboard.before.css`) | 151,196 bytes |
| Optimized (`material-dashboard.after.css`) | 75,945 bytes  |

This represents a reduction of approximately **49.8%** in the Material Dashboard layer alone, exceeding the 20% target.
